- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Theophrat and I am ONLY here to file a complaint about PortableApps and / or Notepad++
- I thought I'd start here since GitHub is where all the great app authors hang pit (or so I'm told)

- I love them both. I use them both.

- BUT after I allowed PA to UPDATE the NP++ on my Sandisk stick, it thereafter rendered ALL Chinese characters in apparently random characters.
I could not find a fix in settings or anywhere I lookd on the NET. And yes, this muck-up has cost me valuable work and a lot of time to work around - ALL 
the more so sinced Chinese is NOT my first language.

Please get this to the people responsible. I don't want to give up either app. I need tools like these: tools that, unlike the powerhouse apps, don't get in my way 
as I work to teach. And, while I cannot code my way out of a wet paper bag, I am one of those pesky professional end-users who depend on what coders do - all the more
so since I'm another "dumb poor teacher" who can't buy cool hi-end tools or outside firms and eat too. 

Thanks,
Theo
